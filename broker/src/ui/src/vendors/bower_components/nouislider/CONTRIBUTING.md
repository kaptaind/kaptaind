# Issues
Please, only use the issue tracker for **problems, bugs and feature requests**.

For help with implementing this slider, ask your question on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nouislider). I look a questions posted there daily, and you will get you an answer much faster.

I can't debug screenshots or issues that do not include an example and required code to reproduce.

# Pull requests
- Detail (in the pull request comment) what your changes do.
- When applicable, include new unit tests. I **can't** and **won't** merge any untested changes.
- If you are introducing a new feature, update the **documentation**.
- **Do NOT** commit `/distribute/*` files, I'll do that upon release.
